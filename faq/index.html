	    to help make it the most secure and private marketplace on tor.<br>

	    <br>
	    <br>
	    <u>1. <b>O.A.R.</b><br><br></u>
	    Our platform supports O.A.R. which is the backbone of this new kind of market that puts our users first.<br>
	    O.A.R changes Oni0nD3p0's website address every 48 hours, which helps keep this market truly private,<br>
	    as only the registered users will have the next valid link and security code via GPG email.<br>
	    So make sure to check your inbox frequently, to stay connected.<br><br>
	    2<u>. <b>O.A.R also has a built in IDS/IPS</b><br><br></u>
	    If we detect malicous traffic that facilitates an attack
	    happening the onion address will change immediately.<br>
	    This will help keep us alive, as its a defense type of mechanism.<br>
	    O.A.R is what helps protect Oni0nD3p0 from attacks and site shutdowns.
